# Eco Africa - Machine Image Editing Prompts

Premium advertising prompts for AI image editors (ChatGPT/DALL-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly) to transform raw machine photos into stylish, brand-ready marketing visuals.

## Brand Context

The Eco Africa website uses a **clean, modern, light theme**:
- Primary green (#16a34a) and blue (#0284c7) brand accents
- White and soft gray (#F9FAFB) surfaces
- Green-to-blue gradient accents
- Professional, trustworthy, eco-conscious tone

Images must feel premium and striking while sitting naturally within this light, sophisticated website. They should work both on the site and as standalone ads.

## Base Prompt Template

> Transform this industrial equipment photo into a stylish, high-quality advertising image that portrays sleek design, industrial strength, and guaranteed performance. Maintain the subject's identity and every key mechanical detail exactly as shown — do not add, remove, or modify any parts. Enhance the overall visual appeal with modern, polished, commercial aesthetics. Place the machine in a clean, minimalistic environment with a soft gradient background that transitions from light warm gray to a subtle hint of cool blue-green. The floor should be a smooth, lightly reflective surface — polished light concrete or clean epoxy. Apply professional lighting: a bright, natural-feeling key light from the upper left, a soft fill from the right to open shadows, and a gentle rim light for clean edge separation. Enhance metallic textures to look premium — stainless steel should have crisp, clean reflections; painted surfaces should look factory-fresh and saturated. Apply clean color grading with balanced contrast, open shadows, and natural highlights. Add subtle depth-of-field with the machine tack-sharp and the background gently softening. The final output should look bold, elegant, and brand-ready — cinematic, visually striking, and suitable for social media ads, website hero sections, and digital marketing. Shot with a Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, f/5.6, 8K resolution, ultra-sharp detail.

## Environment Styles

Rotate these across the catalog for visual variety while keeping a cohesive premium feel.

**Style A — Clean Gradient Studio**: Soft warm gray gradient background with a subtle cool blue-green tint at the edges. Smooth light gray polished floor with a gentle reflection. Bright, airy, modern. *Best for: stainless steel machines where the metal sheen is the star.*

**Style B — Modern Facility**: Subtly blurred clean factory in the background — polished concrete, soft natural light from high windows, white-painted steel beams. Machine in sharp focus on a clean surface. *Best for: large machines that benefit from a sense of scale.*

**Style C — Showroom Hero**: Machine on a clean platform with a softly lit premium showroom feel. Gentle warm accent lighting, soft bokeh highlights, a feeling of space and quality. *Best for: flagship/featured products.*

**Style D — Technical Precision**: Clean light background with faint geometric or grid accents. Crisp, bright lighting emphasizing every component. Slightly elevated camera angle. *Best for: complex machines where detail matters.*
